                                                      And just like in recent weeks, we're expecting a very modest improvement from the previous report. Economists polled by Refinitiv <strong>think 825,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week</strong>. That would be 15,000 fewer claims than <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/08/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">the week before</a>.

                                                      Sure, that's an improvement. But <strong>if that's the pace we're at, it's going to take a long time to get back to pre-pandemic claims levels around 200,000</strong>.
                                                              </p>

                                                      <p>Continued jobless claims, which count workers who have filed for benefits for more than two weeks in a row, are expected at 10.7 million -- compared to just below 11 million in the last report. </p>

                                                      But economists are worried that one reason continued claims are declining <strong>could be that people have maxed out their benefit allowance</strong> (up to 26 weeks of aid) and are instead moving onto other government aid programs. One such program is the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, which provides aid for another 13 weeks.
                                                              </p>

                                                      Well, that's a bit awkward because looking at <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP" target="_blank">manufacturing employment</a> alone, the sector has been in secular decline for some 40 years. Employment in the sector was at its highest in 1979, with 19.6 million jobs. Since then, they have more or less steadily declined. One reason for that is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/economy/robot-jobs-manufacturing-automation/index.html" target="_blank">automation and robots taking over human jobs</a>.

                                                      <p>Manufacturing was hit very hard during the Great Recession starting in 2008, and sector jobs are still not back to where they were in 2007. That's in part why we've seen rather steady job growth in the sector over the past decade — until Covid hit. It's a cycle within a cycle.</p>

They emerged at the start of this year, just in time for the pandemic to hit and put a damper on everything.</p>

                                                      First, some context: The current recession has caused the biggest loss of jobs ever on record, with more than 22 million jobs vanishing during the spring lockdown. Since then, about half of those lost jobs have resurfaced as the economy reopened. But as of September, the US economy was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/02/economy/september-2020-jobs-report-election/index.html" target="_blank">still down 10.7 million jobs compared to February</a>.

                                                      <p>Meanwhile, under Obama, fewer than 9 million jobs were lost between January 2008 and February 2010 -- the peak and trough for employment -- following the financial crisis.</p>
